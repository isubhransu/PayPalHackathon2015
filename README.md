Problem statement:

Milk Money charity wants a mobile application for its volunteers. The application should be able to register the volunteers (social media integration would be nice) and broadcast the upcoming events to them. The users should have the option to RSVP the event invitation. The coordinator then counts the number of people who actually showed up and enters it into the app for future planning purposes. Also, the organization has arrangements with some companies and receives donations from those charities if that company's employees come do charity work for Milk Money.
Solution

An Android app with a MySQL db hosted on google cloud can satisfy all the needs of the client. Our team worked first on database design, application workflow and then began to develop the actual applicaition. The final commit is a working application. It is mostly suitable for demonstration purposes. It has some of the features of the solution we had in mind.
